Computational Geometry Library.

Implementation of a Computational Geometry Library. 
There is an implementation of Point2d class that represents a point on the plane.
The Edge2d class that consists of two points.
In the Predicates class I implement the predicates I have to implement in order to 
build more complex algorithms.
The Convexhull2d is a class that represents a convex hull of 2d points on the plane.
The main class at this version is the CompGeomLibrary in which I will add implementations
of algorithms like Jarvis March and other.  

This version is a beta version in future there will be much more functionality and of
course a Makefile and few examples that will show how my implementations work.
