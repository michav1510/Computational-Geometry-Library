If you want to run the test_parameter constructor that checks 
the implementation of the famous Jarvis algorithm. Otherwise run the 
makefile.
If you have matlab installed :
1)run the generate_random_points_for_testing_CH2d_dlclist.m
2)run the make file 
3)run the sets_os_points.dat
You will see points with blue and the convex hull with red 
lines.
The "sets_of_points.dat" is the file that the test_CH2d_dlclist.cpp
reads and it makes a convex hull and writes it to the "convex_hull_res.dat".
After the plot_data.m read the "sets_of_points.dat" and the 
"convex_hull_res.dat" to plot the input and the output.
